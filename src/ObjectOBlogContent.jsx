    Answers: {
      
      A1: `That is a **great** question. A lot of people say that having expections leads to disappointment. I disagree. 
          I think having expectations sets you up for success. There were things I was expecting and things I wasn't.
          This cohort is no different.
          #### What I was expecting ####
          The cohort of diverse backgrounds and people. Some people think that coders are just young guys nerding out in a basement.
          But that has never been my impression. I knew that coding attracts many different people from many different walks of life.
          From the single mom looking to have a more balanced work-home life, to the young entrepreneur looking to be spotlighted by Forbes 30 under 30.
          This cohort is no different, bringing bright and talented people from all walks of life.
          #### What I wasn't expecting ####
          That getting git would be so hard. I have done some coding before and thought I knew my way around. Boy was I wrong.
          I am getting the hang of it now, but it was a ***very*** rough start.
          I also didnt expect the Awesome Inc. building to be so large and maze-like.
          I've driven past the building every single day for the past two years and even did a virtual tour of it.
          However, when I went home after the onboarding process, I had to weave and wind through hallway after hallway just to find the exit.
          It was kind of fun and reminded me of how solving code can sometimes feel like working through a maze.`,
      
      A2: `I am excited and eager to learn everything; from HTML to Python. 
          I am excited to see if I enjoy backend versus frontend, or if I will like them equally.
          I suspect I will like backend more, but only time will tell.
          I am most eager to learn Python, because of my interest in AI.`,
      
      A3: `Here are some things that you wouldn't know about me except by reading the blog:
          |Favorite | Explanation|
          |---|---|
          |Animal| Fox|
          |Color | Orange... because I love Foxes|

    },
    Answers: {
      A1: `To extend the amount of time in a day. 
          If someone knows how to code for that, I would be eternally grateful.
          I would have all the time in the world to thank you! All joking aside, I wish I was more proficient in CSS.
          There seems to be an unlimited number of possibilities of what a page *could* look like, that I don't even know *what* I want my page to look like.
          I like to know what my options are before I make a decision, which just isn't possible with so many options. `,
      
      A2: `I think I am struggling with time management and/or just having enough time in general. 
          I take care of our son while my wifes works during the day.
          I then "put in my hours" while he is napping and after he has gone to bed.
          However, that means that my brain is not at it's freshest while I am tackling coding challenges or trying to understand a new development principle. `,
      
      A3: `I typically try to assess what the problem is. 
          How wide is it? How tall is it? Who has experienced this before?
          Once I get some context of what the problem seems to be, I approximate a potential solution and work backwards.
          If this is what the solution *should* be, how can I works backwards from it to where I am now?
          I then try to break up those steps into bite size pieces and then move forwards, adjusting when necessary.`,
      
      A4: `I talk to my rubber ducky of course! 
          In lieu of an actual rubber ducky, I just talked out loud to myself like a crazy person, until I come up with my crazy solution.
          It also helps if I take a break and some moments of not thinking about code.
          If it's during the day, I will go outside into my backyard.
          If it's at night, I will make myself come tea and change which room I am in so that I have a full change of scenery.
          Those things usually help.`,

      Q2: "What are some objects that your blog incorporates?",
    },
    Answers: {
      A1: `I think about HTML, CSS, and Javascipt's roles like the those of different parts of the human body. 
          HTML is like the skeleton, it holds everything up and gives it structure.
          There are a lot of different bones (tags), but overall, it isn't overly complicated and is straight forward.
          I think about CSS as the skin.
          It makes the body pretty (or handsome) and makes it unique.
          It's mostly cosmetic but has some ability to add interactivity.
          I think about Javascript as the muscles of the of body.
          It adds a lot of movement and true activity. It receives inputs and produces outputs.
          It's powerful, as you don't have to refresh the get things to work.`,
      
      A2: `I didn't incorporate any objects into my blog. 
          Objects and arrays are really powerful, but I am still playing with them.
          I am currently playing with a layout I really enjoy, but am not really to deploy it.

      A2: `Ironically, being the stay at home parent. 
          My son loves screens and tried playing with my laptop every time I tried coding.
          Also, trying to read, comprehend and learn were hard when that was taking place in a piecemeal fashion.
          A little reading here, a little reading here. What was that I just learned?
          How do I do that again?
          I am also more of an audio-visual learner, so seeing and hearing at the same time help me to retain information much better.`,
      
      A3: `Two words: Energy drinks. 
          Given enough caffeine and enough determination, I was able to get through every challenge.
          Okay... almost every challenge.

      Q3: "What is your “Why”?",
    },
    Answers: {
      A1: `I think the number one thing that held me back this week was rushing into coding before having a plan. 
          I really should have taken the time to read and re-read the assignment.
          I also should have taken a greater amount of time to pseudocode my plan out.
          Especially after demo day, I saw how important a robust pseudocode process is.
          As my classmates presented their projects, I could tell that they had a plan before typing up their code and that they were able to get through their logic because they pseudocoded before hand.`,
      
      A2: `I would like to know how to use objects more. 
          With this mind-reading project, I challenged myself by using objects and arrays of objects.
          I don't fully understand them, but I can tell that they are a powerful tool.
          The fact that you can call variables or functions from a key-value pair seems like there could be endless possibilities.
          I would also like to see what amazing things I can do with them by incorporating them into my code.`,
      
      A3: `I believe compassion is my *why*. When I first went to college, I studied legal studies with the intent of becoming a public . 
          I liked the idea of defending people too poor to afford a lawyer.
          Many years later, I would return to finish my degree, but this time I studied international development with the aim on poverty alleviation.
          I got into banking to see how a bank works and how lending decisions are made because I wanted to see how micro-lending could work as a means to help the poor.
          A change to web development might seem odd, but it is still a part of my *why*.
          With the freedom to work from home, my wife and I will be able to travel to the places we would want to work with and give aid to.
          With greater financial freedom comes the ability to give more and help grow effective non-profits.`,

          This week, I better learned how powerful parameters in functions can be.
          It opened up a whole new way of understanding how to better implement the DRY method.
          I also learned how to implement API's.
          This was incredibly fun and also deepened my understanding of how powerful objects are.`,
      
      A2: `To develop good code, you have to do one simple thing: communicate. 
          There are 13 of us in this boot camp, and each week, we work on the same exact project.
          When demo day comes, there are 13 unique ways to solve the same problem. What this conveys to me, is that the end solution isn't more important than communicating *how* you got to your solution.
          In the future, we will be working with teams. We will most likely inherit some code as well.
          We will have to communicate with one anther to synthesize a solution that is readable and cohesive versus hodge-podge.
          We will also have to heavily comment our code, just like we would have liked our inherited code to be commented. `,
      
      A3: `A good developer has to be open to many different possible solutions (because there are at least 13 possible solutions). 
          They have to be humble enough to ask for help, and collaborative enough to give help.
          They also have to be flexible enough to work with stringent deadline and very strict guidelines.`,

      A4: `I bet one thing programmers hate doing is finding typos. 
          If one variable is spelled wrong throughout the code, I bet it is a pain to find.

    Questions: {
      Q1: "What is pseudocode and how does it help with programming?",
    },
    Answers: {
      A1: `Have you ever found yourself staring at a blank screen, unsure of where to begin when tackling a coding problem? 
          Enter pseudocode – the unsung hero of programming.
          Pseudocode is like the rough draft of your code, a roadmap that helps you navigate the complexities of problem-solving before diving into actual coding.
          It's a high-level description of the logic behind your solution, written in plain language rather than a specific programming language syntax.
          So, how does pseudocode come to the rescue?
          Imagine you're explaining your code to a rubber duck (yes, it's a thing among programmers!).
          By breaking down your solution into simple, human-readable steps, you're essentially talking through the problem with your rubber duck (or yourself) before writing a single line of code.
          This process forces you to clarify your thoughts and ensures you have a solid understanding of the problem at hand.
          But pseudocode isn't just about talking to rubber ducks; it's a powerful tool for improving your coding skills. Here's how:
          1. Clearer Problem Solving: Pseudocode helps you focus on the logic of your solution without getting bogged down by syntax or implementation details. It allows you to think through the problem step by step, ensuring you don't overlook any crucial aspects.
          2. Improved Collaboration: When working in a team, pseudocode serves as a common language that everyone can understand. It bridges the gap between different programming backgrounds and makes it easier to discuss and refine solutions together.
          3. Easier Debugging: By breaking down your solution into smaller, manageable chunks, pseudocode makes it easier to identify and fix errors. You can spot potential issues early on, saving you time and frustration down the line.
          Pseudocode isn't just a stepping stone to writing code – it's a mindset shift that empowers you to become a better programmer.
          So next time you're stuck on a coding problem, grab your rubber duck and start sketching out some pseudocode.
          You'll be amazed at the clarity it brings to your thinking and the efficiency it adds to your coding process.`,

    Answers: {
      A1: `I have learned that a command line interface, or CLI is very powerful. 
          Anything that you can do "normally" on a computer, you can do through the CLI.
          Want to create a new folder? No problem for the CLI. You would like to move a file?
          The CLI can do that! You would like to delete something? The CLI can do that too.
          It was scary at first to use the CLI, but not any more.
          At first, it was scary because there is no immediate feedback telling you that what you did was the correct thing done the correct way.
          I created folders in weird places. I deleted files I didn't mean to.
          I created folders inside folders inside folders. It was like the movie Inception, but way less amusing.

      A3: `Frameworks make life easier and often times make coding more efficient. 
          Without a framework or a library, I would be left to reinvent the wheel.
          It is important to at least learn how the wheel is built, but if I have to rebuild one for every single project, a lot of time would be wasted.
